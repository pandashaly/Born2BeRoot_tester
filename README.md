## Introduction
üîç Born to be root can be long, boring, and confusing, making it challenging to grasp the multitude of commands and configurations. In an attempt to better understand the commands, and intricacies of system configurations and simplify the evaluation process for myself and other 42 students I created this tester. I hope you find it helpful!

Additional Information

### Neofetch Installation

#### What is neofetch?

Neofetch is a command-line utility that displays system information in a visually appealing way. It provides details about your OS, kernel, CPU, GPU, memory, and more, and it often includes an ASCII art representation of the distribution's logo. It's not necessary, but it's a pretty fun addition to show your evaluator what OS you chose and to show that the GUI enabled! ^_^

#### Installation Instructions

If `neofetch` is not already installed on your system, you can install it using the following commands:

Debian/Ubuntu:

`sudo apt-get install neofetch`

Mac (using Homebrew):

`brew install neofetch`

Bonus Section
-------------

-   Monitoring Script: The script checks for a monitoring script running every 10 minutes using cron. Review and update the script as needed.
-   Website URL (Bonus): If applicable, a bonus section provides information about a website.
-   Ensure proper setup and configuration. You need to be able to show that your free choice service is installed and running.
